## Presentation Requirements

Interested in sharing your project with the BitDevs community at a Socratic Seminar? Great! To qualify for a presentation slot you must satisfy the below requirements. 

Please note that all presentations are capped at 12 minutes, with an additional 5 minutes for Q&A. 

- The content of your presentation must be directly relevant to a technical audience that is interested in:
   - How the Bitcoin protocol works.
   - Innovations that improve the inner workings of the Bitcoin protocol.
   - Projects that strengthen the ecosystem (e.g. make it easier/safer to interact with, tooling for developers, etc.).
- Your project must be:
  - Technically innovative (rehashing of existing tech in a new product would not qualify, unless the implementation is demonstrably novel). 
  - Live, or code published if it is FOSS.
- You must work directly on the project and have strong understanding of its fundamentals. 
	- Be prepared to answer technical questions about how the project is implemented.
- The presentation must be centered around a live demo, anything more then 3-5 minutes of slides is not allowed without explicit approval.
- Your presentation must be complete 1 week before the event.
  - Be prepared to do a dry run of your presentation with the BitDevs organization team. 
- You cannot solicit investment from our audience in any way.
