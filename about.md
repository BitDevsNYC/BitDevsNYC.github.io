BitDevs Cotonou is inpired by Bitdevs NYC & Lagos to help grow a community in Cotonou and other part of Benin of those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will
be technical.

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha, Electrum, Breez), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors, X (Twitter) post and more. After a period of discussion, some events will have presentations of open source projects, companies, research and other relevant content. A feedback and Q&A section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to socialize when possible.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event can be recorded with permissions.
It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin
in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events. It that is not the case, let other participants know to get some basics ressources.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic
event or have a recommended topic for discussion: bitdevscotonou at gmail. There
are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the
project.

### Whitepaper Series

A journal club to discuss specific topics in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is an
academic-style journal club where one person chooses a topic or paper and
presents it. Participants are expected to have read the paper or other material
suggested by the discussion leader. The discussion leader doesn’t have to be an
expert on the subject, but should be interested enough in it to read the paper
thoroughly so as to give a decent presentation. After informally presenting the
topic, the group can then ask questions or open discussion surrounding the
topic. The presentation should be informal (slides are allowed, but
whiteboard/chalkboard is preferred), and this should be a discussion, not a
one-way transmission of information by the presenter. The reading material
doesn’t have to be a whitepaper. In the case of widely-known topics (such as
Elliptic Curve encryption) a chapter of a textbook, Wikipedia article, or other
material can be suggested.

To propose a topic to present or volunteer to present a paper, please contact
bitdevsnyc at gmail.

### Debate Series

Our debate series is dedicated to the investigation of controversial technical
topics. The structure of the event is dependent on the topic of interest.
