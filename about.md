BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will
be technical.

This meetup is the Norfolk chapter of [BitDevs in NYC](https://bitdevs.org).

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by the meetup organizer from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories, research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. After the event the group gathers at a nearby bar or
restaurant to socialize.

### Reading Groups

A reading group is much like a socratic seminar focused on a single topic. Our
goal is to drive improved understanding of the topic for all meeting
participants. The primary reading materials will be posted on the event page of
this site and on the meetup.com event page. Participants are expected to study
the material before attending and bring discussion questions to help drive
understanding. During the reading group session we will summarize the main points
of the reading material and try to answer every attendees' discussion questions.
