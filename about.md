BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. 

BitDevs was first [started in New York City](https://bitdevs.org) and has since spread
to cities around the world. The institution is time honored: it has facilitated
rewarding discussions about Bitcoin's technical scene for many years.

Be advised: discussion will be technical! But don't let that dissuade you from coming;
all levels of familiarity with Bitcoin are encouraged to participate.

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. To complete the meeting, members present open source
projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A
section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to
socialize.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER
recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin
in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic
event or have a recommended topic for discussion: dcbitdevs at gmail. There
are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the
project.
