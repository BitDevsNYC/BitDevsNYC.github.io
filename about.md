BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will
be technical.

This meetup is the Raleigh/Durham chapter of [BitDevs in NYC](https://bitdevs.org).

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. To complete the meeting, members present open source
projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A
section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby bar or restaurant
to socialize.
