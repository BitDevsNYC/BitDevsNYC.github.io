- [Why Full-RBF Makes DoS Attacks on Multiparty Protocols Significantly More Expensive](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-January/021322.html)
- Version Handshake
  Bitcoin core developer Bruno Garcia has published an [excellent technical dive](https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoin-core-notes/blob/main/general-notes/net_processing_version_handshake.md) into the version handshake. Sometimes referred to as "the dance", this is the process by which a bitcoin node introduces itself to another node to begin sharing p2p data.

1. **Route Blinding**
  Vanilla lightning payments have great privacy properties for the sender of a payment, but quite bad privacy for the recipient. [Route blinding](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/route-blinding/proposals/route-blinding.md) is a proposal to fix this gap. It works by having the payment recipient conceal the last few hops of the payment route using cryptographic blinding. And after 2.5 long years it's [almost ready](https://twitter.com/realtbast/status/1603053124356390914) for use in the real world!

1. **Opening and announcing a pre-taproot LN channel**
  Elle Mouton drops another [üî• blog post](https://ellemouton.com/posts/open_channel_pre_taproot/) chock full of diagrams all about the steps required to open a lightning channel today (pre-taproot).

- **Ordinal Inscriptions: NFTs on bitcoin.** [ordinals.com](https://ordinals.com) is a site to browse ordinal inscriptions, a new NFT scheme built on bitcoin by SF BitDevs host [@rodarmor](https://twitter.com/rodarmor). Ordinal theory is a scheme to number and track every satoshi based on its issuance date. Inscriptions are a scheme to associate on-chain metadata to a single satoshi ordinal. The data is stored in the tx witness script, leading to heated debates about whether inscriptions are a good or bad thing. The debate is sure to heat up after this [absolute unit](https://ordinals.com/inscription/0301e0480b374b32851a9462db29dc19fe830a7f7d7a88b81612b9d42099c0aei0) of an inscription took up [almost an entire bitcoin block](https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000515e202c8ae73c8155fc472422d7593af87aa74f2cf3d).
