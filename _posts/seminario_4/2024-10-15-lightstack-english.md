[Lightstack](https://github.com/massmux/lightstack)

- Lightstack is a new docker-compose-based method for merchants who want to accept Lightning payments quickly and easily

## Background
- Why is merchant adoption important for bitcoin's success?
- Why is accepting Lightning as a merchant difficult, unless you trust a third party?
  - Why is trusting third parties with bitcoin a bad idea?
- Why is accepting on-chain bitcoin not viable for some merchants?

## How does Lightstack work?
- What is a Docker image?
- What is Docker Compose? (see: https://github.com/massmux/lightstack/blob/main/docker-compose.yml.example)
- What is Phoenixd?
- What is LNBits?
- What are the tradeoffs between using this method vs more sovereign methods (bitcoin full node) and less sovereign methods (WoS)?

## Preguntas
- What are some other Lightning point-of-sale systems?
  - Is Lightstack better or worse than these?
- What kind of person should use Lightstack?
