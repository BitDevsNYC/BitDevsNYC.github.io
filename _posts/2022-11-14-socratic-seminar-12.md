# Bitcoin Core

#### Bitcoin Core 24.0 Release Candidate Testing Guide

Bitcoin core contributor [kouloumos](https://twitter.com/kouloumos) put together a [testing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/24.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide) for the [24.0 release candidate](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/24.0-Release-Notes-draft). There's a lot of cool stuff in this release, check out his twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/kouloumos/status/1574483503655403524) to see the highlights in 280 char chunks.

#### [PR merged] wallet: fast rescan with BIP157 block filters for descriptor wallets
PR #25957 enables fast wallet rescan using compact block filters, only for descriptor wallets.

#### When Taproot?

[When Taproot?](https://whentaproot.org/) is a cool new site promoting adoption of taproot. It examines the stages of adoption for wallets, exchanges, and other services, why taproot adoption is a good thing, and how you can help.

#### BIP 351
https://privatepayments.org
A stealth address protocol for Bitcoin - makes it possible for two parties to transact using addresses that only they can calculate.


# Lightning

#### Lightning

**CLN Channel Splicing Draft PR**

Dustin Dettmer has opened a draft PR to enable channel splicing on CLN. There is a long list of TODO items to get this PR across the finish line but this feature represents a massive improvement to LN usability.


#### Advances in Channel Jamming Research

The prolifically productive dream team Gleb Naumenko and Antoine Riard have released a series of research reports examining [channel jamming](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/channel-jamming-attacks/). Read the [lightning-dev post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-August/003673.html) for a brief summary or dive into the [gitbook](https://jamming-dev.github.io/book/) and read the whole shebang.

#### Taro alpha release

[Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering/) has released the taro daemon alpha. Despite what the name might imply the taro daemon is not a little monster that steals your root vegetables, it is a tool to issue and transfer assets on bitcoin and lightning. Check out this [blog post](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-9-28-taro-launch/) for the English explanation or [the repo](https://github.com/lightninglabs/taro/) if you want to get technical.

#### Onion Messages and Asynchronous Lightning Payments

[LDK](https://lightningdevkit.org/) developer [vallywal](https://twitter.com/vallywal) explains how onion messages not only unlock bolt12 offers and blinded routes, but the combination of onion messages and PTLCs [enable async payments](https://lightningdevkit.org/blog/onion-messages-demystified/) over lightning that don't lock up network liquidity. Really tho, the awesomest part of this blog post is all the ðŸ”¥ diagrams.


# Chaumian Mints

#### Fedimint launches on signet

Signet is one of many bitcoin test nets. A [signet launch](https://twitter.com/EricSirion/status/1572329210727010307) represents a big step towards a production ready codebase. [Very exciting](https://i.imgur.com/y1cnodp.gif)!

#### Cashu

[Cashu](https://github.com/callebtc/cashu) is a Chaumian Ecash wallet and mint. It's written in python and has only lightning support, no on-chain transactions. It's like fedimint without a federation. Plus they have an awesome new [icon](https://twitter.com/callebtc/status/1582666047315841025).

# Privacy

#### Bisq
Buy and sell bitcoin privately and securely on a Bisq's peer-to-peer network.

#### PayJoin
A type of coinjoin where merchant and buyer create a coordinated transaction. Coordination happens with PayToEndPoint [P2EP] concept. PayJoins obfuscates the total amount being payed and breaks the common ownership heuristic. Has a fallback to ordinary tx. Another benefit is that the merchant saves money by consolidating (assuming higher tx fees in the future).


# Scalability

#### Taro Skepticism

A critical look at the [scalability properties](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/scaling-problem-for-lightning-labs-taro) of the Taro protocol if deployed on the bitcoin blockchain
