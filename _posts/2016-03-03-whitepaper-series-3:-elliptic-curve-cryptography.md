Elliptic curve cryptography is the engine behind all crypto-currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum, using the secp256k1 curve.  Sean Spillane will lead a discussion of elliptic curves and their use in crypto-currencies.  There is a tremendous amount of material available on this topic, including a lot of youtube video presentations.  Please read at least one of the references below and come prepared to participate in the discussion. If there are sub-topics you want to dive into, please comment on this event on meetup.com and suggest other literature.
