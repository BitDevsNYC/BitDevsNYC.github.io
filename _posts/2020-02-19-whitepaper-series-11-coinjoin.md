meetup: tba
---

Proposed in 2013 by Greg Maxwell, CoinJoin is a multi-party input aggregation protocol that breaks the “common-input-ownership” heuristic, a blockchain analysis technique commonly applied to Bitcoin’s transaction graph. Why CoinJoins work and under what circumstances they can fail are important questions. This event will start from the beginning: we will learn about the history of CoinJoin, how research has evolved in the space and what the differences are between the currently available implementations.

There is quite a lot of ground to cover, much of which you can find below. I will continue adding to this list as the weeks progress, but below is an overview of some of the subject matter we will cover. The event may turn into a multi-part series depending on how the first event unfolds. The only prerequisite knowledge you *MUST* have to participate in this event is a basic understanding of Bitcoin’s unspent transaction output model. 

This event will be led by J. If I missed something or you have a CoinJoin-related topic you would like see included in the event, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/BitDevsNYC/BitDevsNYC.github.io/edit/master/_posts/2020-02-19-whitepaper-series-11-coinjoin.md) or make a comment on the [meetup event page](FIXME link to meetup page).
