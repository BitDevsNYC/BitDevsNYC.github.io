This will be our first meetup. We will ease into it: we will lay out some basic
ground rules, make introductions and jump off from there.

Some topics to start off with: Bitcoin protocol improvements (Taproot, BIP 119(CTV)
multi signature transactions, etc...) or off-chain
technology(lightning network, discreet log contracts, etc...)
