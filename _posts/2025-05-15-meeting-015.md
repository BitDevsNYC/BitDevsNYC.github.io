## Socratic Seminar

As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follow:

1. **No photos, videos, or recordings.**
2. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely
