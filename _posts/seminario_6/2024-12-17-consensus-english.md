# [**The Consensus Conundrum**](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support)

### Overview

- Prominent bitcoin dev James O'Beirne (jamesob) tweeted this out in an apparent attempt to break the consensus logjam.

Bitcoin is facing a unique leadership problem as it attempts to implement consensus changes.

- Many **consensus-change proposals** are currently on the table, each with valid motivations, such as scaling UTXO ownership or improving self-custody.
- Historically, successful upgrades like **Segwit** and **Taproot** operated under a form of *benevolent dictatorship*, where decisions were effectively signed off by a single leader or a small oligarchy.
- Now, Bitcoin is in **leaderless mode**, attempting a novel meritocratic process that has never been tried.

### Key Factors in the "Consensus Conundrum"
1. **Leadership Vacuum**
   - Former "benevolent dictators" have stepped back, leaving Bitcoin without a clear decision-making structure.

2. **Wide Design Space**
   - The range of improvements (e.g., vaults, rollups, CTV, generic tools) offers no clear "correct" solution.
   - All opinions and approaches have merit, creating ambiguity.

3. **Immense Effort Required**
   - Developing proposals is time-consuming, mentally draining, and requires years of experience with Core development.
   - Businesses lack the resources or interest to meaningfully support speculative upgrades.

### The Resulting Challenges
- **Leaderlessness vs. Progress**: Inaction (ossification) is still a consequential decision, especially as rule changes will become harder as Bitcoin adoption grows (e.g., nation-states buying in).
- **Core Developers' Role**: Although Core devs claim to "just merge what has consensus," historically, their approval has been necessary for changes to occur.
- **Focus Misalignment**: Core development has become more focused on secondary priorities like mempool work, which may not address Bitcoin's scaling and self-custody issues.

### Broader Concerns
- Bitcoin is not currently scaling to meet global needs.
- Self-custody remains nerve-wracking and inaccessible for casual users.
- The lack of leadership and reluctance to engage with consensus proposals could cause Bitcoin to fall short of its potential.

### Final Thoughts
The author offers no concrete solutions but hopes that raising these uncomfortable issues will inspire progress toward scaling self-custody and improving Bitcoin's long-term functionality.

> *"Most longstanding, fully specified fork proposals are totally fine and would conceptually improve Bitcoin."*

### Questions

- Should we update bitcoin's consensus rules?
  - Why or why not?
- What is the best way to activate upgrades on bitcoin?
