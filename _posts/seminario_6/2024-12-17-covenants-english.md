[Covenants Support Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support)

- User "1440000bytes" aka "/dev/fd0" aka "Floppy Disk Guy" has created a page on the Bitcoin Wiki listing a few dozen bitcoin devs and their opinions about a potential forthcoming soft fork to add covenants to bitcoin
- Any bitcoin dev can edit the page and add their opinions to it
- This is simliar to the [support page for Segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support) and was most likely inspired by it
- The page has (at the moment) 42 developers' opinions listed, 15 of which have links to a rationale
  - A rationale is important so that viewers can understand why devs are for or against a given proposal
  - Opinions without rationales are thus given less weight

## Questions

- What are covenants?
- Why is it important to poll devs to see what they support?
- Which proposals do you support?
