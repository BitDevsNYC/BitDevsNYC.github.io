[Phoenix](https://x.com/PhoenixWallet/status/1844377194489053555)

- Phoenix Wallet has implemented [BLIP36, an LSP spec for providing on-the-fly channel funding](https://github.com/t-bast/blips/blob/on-the-fly-funding/blip-0036.md)
- The protocol uses HTLCs, zero-conf channels, splicing, and liquidity ads in order to allow a payment to complete even if the receiver does not have enough inbound liquidity

## Questions

- What is a channel splice?
