We have special guests for this event, Zooko Wilcox of [http://z.cash](http://z.cash)Â .

For a brief introduction to Zerocash, see: [http://zerocash-project.org/how\_zerocash\_works](http://zerocash-project.org/how_zerocash_works) . The reading for this meeting is their protocol paper, [http://zerocash-project.org/paper](http://zerocash-project.org/paper) . There is a shorter conference version at 16 pages, and an extended paper too. Please read this paper and come prepared to ask questions!

We expect this event to be popular, but if you can't commit to reading the paper, please consider coming to the following Socratic meetup instead, at which we will present a brief recap of this Whitepaper event.

Special thanks to Rise New York for sponsoring the location! thinkrise.com
