We regularly host guest speakers at our Socratic Seminar events to talk about
technical contributions to the community. The talks  are _not_ for promoting
products or services.

We have some guidelines to make sure that the talk is useful and relevant for
our members:

- You **must not** solicit investment from our audience in any way.
- All presentations are capped at 15 minutes, including question time.
- The content of your presentation must be directly relevant to a technical
  audience that is interested in:
  - How the Bitcoin protocol works.
  - Innovations that improve the inner workings of the Bitcoin protocol.
  - Projects that strengthen the ecosystem (e.g. make it easier/safer to
    interact with, tooling for developers, etc.).
- Your project must be:
  - Technically innovative (rehashing of existing tech in a new product would
    not qualify, unless the implementation is demonstrably novel).
  - Live, or code published if it is FOSS.
- You must work directly on the project and have strong understanding of its
  fundamentals. You should be prepared to answer technical questions about how
  the project is implemented.
- The presentation must be centered around a live demo. Anything more than 3-5
  minutes of slides is not allowed without explicit approval.
- Your presentation must be complete 1 week before the event. Be prepared to do
  a dry run of your presentation with the BitDevs organization team.

If you're interested in sharing your project with the BitDevs community we'd
love to host you.
