SECURITY QUESTION REQUIRED

Bob McElrath will lead a 1-hour, informal discussion on the following topic. Please try to read the paper ahead of time and come with questions.  It's a good idea to bring a printout of the paper.  Pizza and beer will be provided by SolidX. Afterwards we will head to Cock and Bull (23 W. 45th St. for drinks and further discussion).  Feel free to join us directly there about 8:30.

A peer-to-peer network, enabling different parties to jointly store and run computations on data while keeping the data completely private. Enigma’s computational model is based on a highly optimized version of secure multi-party computation, guaranteed by a verifiable secret-sharing scheme. For storage, we use a modified distributed hashtable for holding secret-shared data. An external blockchain is utilized as the controller of the network, manages access control, identities and serves as a tamper-proof log of events. Security deposits and fees incentivize operation, correctness and fairness of the system. Similar to Bitcoin, Enigma removes the need for a trusted third party, enabling autonomous control of personal data. For the first time, users are able to share their data with cryptographic guarantees regarding their privacy.
