Our first meetup of the year will be held early in month instead of on the last Thursday. There will be several special guests in town the week of the 8th and we look forward to meeting up with them!

Please join us for our next Socratic Seminar. A special thank you to our sponsors [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com) and [Cake Wallet](https://www.cakewallet.com/) for food, refreshments and event space.

If you can't make it to the main event please join us at [PUBKEY](https://pubkey.bar/home) around 9:30PM.
