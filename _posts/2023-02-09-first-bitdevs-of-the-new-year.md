## BitDevs Amsterdam meeting 002!

Come join us for the first Bitdevs of 2023! After spending the holidays not talking about Bitcoin at all (lol), it's time to get together and catch up on all the cool stuff that's been happening. A big thanks to [Bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/) for sponsoring us with the meeting space and snacks! Drinks and light snacks will be provided, so please ensure you have some dinner beforehand or bring it along to the seminar.

### Thursday, February 09th 2023 @ 7PM

As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follow:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely
within the event.

# Agenda

Theres been a lot of discussion recently about covenants and how they might be implemented, so we figured why not talk about all of them! We'll be discussing the new OP_VAULT proposal primarily, but have also included links to the other covenant proposals for context.
