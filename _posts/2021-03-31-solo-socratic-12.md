## Announcements

Until our community can meet again in person, we'll continue to share all the
latest research and developments through our monthly newsletter. Please note
that we have broken out a new section titled New Releases that contains links
to recently released/updated software. This content was previously catalogued
in the Miscellaneous section. As a reminder, inclusion of software in this list
is not an endorsement of any kind.
