We will start with introductions, some basic ground rules, and jump into technical discussions. 
We will cover aspects of the bitcoin protocol, new research developments, recent news, and
software developments.

This month we will have [Varun Madathil](https://twitter.com/Varun_2703) join us to describe his 
research on a new cryptographic primitive (VweTS) and its application to DLC oracle signatures!

Note: This is a preliminary agenda. It is subject to change before the event date.
