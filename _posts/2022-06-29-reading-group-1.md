This reading group discussion will focus on [BIP-118](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/sighash_anyprevout/) and the [Eltoo](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/) proposal. Eltoo is a 
layer 2 scaling proposal that greatly simplifies lightning network channel state 
management. Eltoo removes the need for penalty transactions which is expected to bring 
significant improvements to restore-from-backup processes, channel factories, and 
hardware signing devices.
