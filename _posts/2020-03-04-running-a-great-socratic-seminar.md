In New York, we've been running a monthly [Socratic
Seminar](/about#socratic-seminars) since 2013. The goal of these events
is to have participants learn from each other in the style of a [Socratic
Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Socratic_Circles). This
format works for our community because it encourages participation from
attendees and keeps content fresh, and it also breaks reliance on outside
presenters for content.

We've learned a lot by running these events over the years and have tried lots
of experiments and iterations. Some ideas work well and become regular
features. Others don't, and are abandoned. This blog post is an attempt to
distil that experience so you can apply it to your own local Bitcoin community.

## Finding a Location

The first step is to find event space. Getting this right is critical, and
having a reliable and regular venue will make your job as a host _much_ easier.

The main requirements for a location are that:

- it's quiet,
- there's ample seating, and
- there's a projector or large monitor setup.
- (as your group grows in size, you may also want some kind of microphone setup)

Don't let the lack of microphone or projector deter you from from an otherwise
appropriate venue -- you can bring your own if you have no other choice.

If you don't have an immediately obvious venue, here are some connections you
can try:

- Hosts and organizers of other bitcoin/crypto meetups in your city
- Your members
- Crypto/bitcoin clubs at local universities
- Crypto/bitcoin companies in your city
- Co-working spaces
- Local libraries
- Hacker spaces

## Building a Community

Once you have a venue, you'll want to promote the event. You only need a
handful of people for a Socratic Seminar, so don't stress over having a massive
turnout in the beginning. The most important things are consistency and
reliability -- if you schedule the events regularly (e.g. once a month) your
attendance will trend upwards over time. Also, don't be worried about there
being no enthusiasts in your local community. Create a space for
thoughtful and advanced discussion and you'll probably be surprised by who
shows up.

Some ways to promote your event:

- Create a public group on [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and tag it with
  crypto-related
  [topics](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002877731-Editing-my-group-s-topics).
- Go to other crypto meetups and share your event with members of those groups.
- Announce your event in the usual planes online (Reddit, Twitter, etc.).
- Connect with organizers of Socratic Seminars in other cities and tap into
  their networks.
- If you're aware of specific people within a reasonable distance of your
  meetup who would be strong candidates for participating in the discussion,
  invite them individually! Good candidates are domain experts or people with
  very specific interests in an area that you would like to cover.
- If there are interesting conferences, hackathons, etc. in your city, organize
  an event the same week and invite any visiting experts.

If you specifically invite people with expert knowledge, let them know that
you'd like their participation in the discussion -- people will not naturally
come prepared to engage, so you have to foster that environment.

## Discovering Content

The next hurdle is content discovery and collation. Topics we often look at
include:

- Critical vulnerabilities in popular hardware and software
- Network statistics and phenomena (e.g. oscillations in the
  mempool/difficulty/UTXO set, reorgs, 51% attacks, double spends)
- Mailing list posts with interesting proposals or critiques
- Pull requests from popular repositories that include substantial changes
- Research papers relevant to bitcoiners
- Blog posts on privacy, software development, cryptography and more

There are many Socratic style meetups worldwide which post their content
online; going through their recent events will give you a lot of materials to
choose from (e.g. [New York](https://bitdevs.org/events.html), [San
Francisco](https://www.sfbitcoindevs.org), [Berlin](https://bitdevs.berlin)).
The [Optech newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/) is also a good
source of relevant content.

Tailor the content to what the attendees will find interesting. It's OK if you
aren't having the exact same discussion that another city is having. Maybe people
in your part of the world are more excited about privacy, or maybe you live in
a financial capital and your attendees are interested in regulation. Make it
your own and tailor it to the people that show up consistently.

## Preparation - Content

With content selected, it's time to prepare yourself to lead the discussion.
First, read and highlight the material. There are highlighting plugins for all
browsers. Use highlights to emphasize important content on the page -- they're
a good mnemonic device for the host and they help drive discussion. That said,
be careful not to use the highlights as a crutch -- if you exclusively read
word-for-word from the links and do not engage the crowd, you'll lose their
attention and discussion will fall flat.

Generally, preparing slides isn't useful or necessary -- it takes a long time
to prepare, and people want to see the source material anyway.

Arrange the tabs in your browser, starting with the things
you would like to cover first. Warm the crowd up with a topic that has
relevance for the whole group and is ripe for discussion. Examples are less
technically detailed blog posts or Stack Overflow answers. From there, move on
to more technical content (e.g. pull requests, BIPs, BOLTs, etc..).  Finish the
meetup by covering or demoing fun projects (e.g. lightning games). Use a browser
plugin to save your tabs in case your browser crashes or device loses power.

Next, you should practice explaining the content in front of a mirror or by
recording yourself. It may sound strange but this really will uncover holes in
your knowledge and make you aware of which concepts you can't articulate clearly.
The more you prep, the more enjoyable the event will be, both for you
and the attendees. Your goal is to have enough understanding of the material so
that you can contextualize the content in a way which avoids the attendees
feeling completely lost.

There is always more to learn. Do your best to prepare, but don't overextend
yourself. As host, you're there to guide discussion, not to be an expert on
everything. Be open to making mistakes and encourage the crowd to
participate. Treat the event like the review process for open source software:
stand on the shoulder of giants and use the event to improve your and everyone
else's understanding.

## Preparation - Venue

Even small details about the space can have a big impact on the success of the
event. A bit of care and preparation here will pay dividends!

Triple check all the details with your venue host. The worst meetup experience
we've had was when we had to cancel a Socratic with no notice because of a
miscommunication with the venue.

Always bring every possible converter and extension cable you may need to the
event (e.g.  HDMI extension, VGA to X, DVI to X and HDMI to X). We have a
dedicated Socratic bag where all of this gear lives permanently. That way we
can never forget any of it.

At the venue, set up a table at the front of the room so you are at the same
level as the crowd. For smaller groups, arrange the seating in a circle. This
enables anyone to look each other in the eyes and fosters high quality
conversations.

## Leading Discussion

Start by welcoming everyone and explaining the format. In New York, we don't
record the event or allow people to take pictures. This is both out of respect
for our members' privacy, and also allows people to speak their mind without
fear that their words will be taken out of context online. Have some pens
and paper available for people who want to take notes.

Give everyone 10 seconds to introduce themselves and mention a topic that
interests them. People may announce other events, job listings, tell jokes and
share other things relevant to your members. This brings members closer
together, and gives people a chance to get to know each other.

Set the expectation that Bitcoin fundamentals (e.g. what a hash function is)
will not be explained at each event. That said, when there are new
concepts, schemes or mechanisms being introduced, make sure to explain and
contextualize them. For example, if you are going to explain a new opcode, you
may need to briefly explain how opcodes work, talk about pre-existing opcodes
and then explain the merits and drawbacks of the proposal.  You should be
welcoming to new attendees but your main target should be members who come to
each event -- find a way to quickly explain recurring themes in snippets so you
do not bore people who regularly attend the events.

Once you've established context, discussion can begin. Sometimes that happens
organically. If not, then having some prepared questions can make
the attendees think about the material in a way that encourages participation.
Not every topic requires discussion, and don't avoid subject matter you think
is important because it may not be interesting for discussion. You're telling a
story: some topics are minor plot devices while others are more central
elements of "the conversation".

There are some topics which can lead to circular, tangential or virulent
discussion. As the moderator you should not be afraid of cutting off comments
which undermine a respectful atmosphere or stymie the discussion. Avoid
tired debates (e.g. block size, segwit), as there's no novel or insightful
discussion to be had. Set the tone as the host. Cultivate a respectful and
focused style, and others will generally follow your lead.

There's no correct time length for a Socratic -- it really depends on your
group's preferences. However, you should manage your time and try to finish at
the advertised end time. Respect that many people have families or come from
far away and need to get home at a reasonable hour. For attendees who haven't
had enough, discussion can continue in the nearest bar!

## Miscellaneous Tips

A few final tips to make your event even more enjoyable:

- Short guest presentations at the end can be very exciting. We recommend
  following these [rules](https://bitdevs.org/presenter-guidelines/) to ensure
  high quality presentations that are relevant to attendees.
- Find a place after the event to gather for drinks and food. Post this on the
  meetup page so people who cannot make the main event can join for the after
  party.
- If you can find a sponsor to provide food, great! But be careful who you get
  in bed with -- we do not recommend taking sponsorship from ICOs and altcoins
  for obvious reasons.
- Most importantly, have fun! Building a local community around shared values
  and common interests requires consistent work, but can be enormously
  rewarding.
